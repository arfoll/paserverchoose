paserverchoose by Brendan Le Foll, brendan <at> fridu <dot> net

This code is based on padevchooser. Not much is left, but it was quicker to start this way.

I haven't changed anything in x11prop and the code should still be compatible with now 'dead' upstream padevchooser

The avahibrowse.c module is mostly an adaptation of some sample code from the avahi documentation and is not particularly pretty or nice.

Included are a PKGBUILD file for packaging in Arch Linux with makepkg and a yaml file for Meego use with spectacle, and a spec file generated by specify for Meego but that can easily be adapted for Fedora/Opensuse etc...
